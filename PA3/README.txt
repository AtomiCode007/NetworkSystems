Hooo boy, this assignment was a doozy. 

I used the backbone of PA2 for the base of this assignment. I then added the base for the proxy server by adding the functionality to send the contents directly to the client. I then added the blacklist which is read in from a text file, and updated with each new connection. After that I created a new directory for the cache file to be stored in, struggled with the MD5 checksum as Apple has deprecated the openssl library in favor of another cryptography library. After that, the request will check the cache for the specific file and read it to the client. If the file is old, then it will delete it and continue to request a new one from the web server. Before it is done it makes sure that it is not a black listed site. Once its made it to this point it will send off the content to the client.
